# Mindspan Labs Agents

Battle-tested configuration for running a fleet of Claude Code bots as 24/7 Telegram agents with persistent memory, automatic recovery, scheduled tasks, inter-agent coordination, and 45+ reusable agent skills.

## What This Is

We run six Claude Code bots on a single machine via Telegram — a **Chief of Staff** (email, calendar, admin), a **CTO** (cross-project architecture, standards), two **VP Engineering** bots (one per project), a **DevOps** lead (fleet management), and a **Product Marketing** agent (research, content). After months in production, we hit real problems and built solutions for each one. This repo contains those solutions as reusable templates.

**What you get**: You message a Telegram bot from your phone, and Claude Code responds — with full access to your codebase, files, terminal, databases, and any MCP tools you've configured. It remembers what you were working on across session restarts, coordinates with other bots via an inbox system, proactively does things on a schedule, and auto-recovers when it hits context limits.

## The Problems We Solved

| # | Problem | Solution | Docs |
|---|---------|----------|------|
| 1 | **Bot forgets everything after restart** — context window fills up, session "bakes", all conversation history is lost | Structured state file + mandatory save-before-reply hooks | [State File & Hooks](docs/state-file-and-hooks.md) |
| 2 | **No scheduled/proactive behavior** — bot only responds when messaged | Cron scripts running `claude -p` one-shots, independent of the channel bot | [Cron Jobs](docs/cron-jobs.md) |
| 3 | **Bot can't access files outside working directory** | `--add-dir` flags in start scripts | [Start Scripts](examples/start-scripts/) |
| 4 | **Multiple bots producing conflicting information** | Explicit role boundaries and redirect rules in CLAUDE.md | [Role Isolation](docs/role-isolation.md) |
| 5 | **Bot reports "RUNNING" but is actually dead** — tmux session exists but Claude is idle at the prompt | Watchdog cron that inspects the tmux pane and auto-restarts baked bots | [Watchdog](examples/watchdog/) |
| 6 | **WSL doesn't auto-start bots on Windows reboot** | Windows Startup batch file + boot script + systemd | [WSL Auto-Start](docs/wsl-autostart.md) |
| 7 | **Bot can't search its own history** — weeks of context across scattered files | SQLite FTS5 search index across all memory files | [Memory Search](examples/memory-search/) |
| 8 | **Bot doesn't learn about you over time** — re-explain preferences every session | Structured user profile + PostToolUse learning loop | [Personalization](docs/personalization.md) |
| 9 | **Context compaction loses important state** | PreCompact emergency save + PostCompact reload | [Compaction Hooks](docs/extensions.md#problem-9-context-compaction-loses-important-state) |
| 10 | **Credentials scattered across scripts** | Centralized env file sourced by all scripts | [Credentials](examples/credentials/) |
| 11 | **Bots can't coordinate with each other** — tasks that span roles fall through the cracks | File-based inbox system with priority routing and hook-driven checks | [Inter-Agent Communication](docs/inter-agent-communication.md) |
| 12 | **Hook changes are error-prone across many bots** — manual edits to 6 settings files is fragile | Fleet hook automation script that generates validated configs for all bots | [Fleet Hooks](examples/fleet-hooks/) |

## Quick Start

### New to all of this? Start here:
1. Read the **[How-To Guide](docs/how-to-guide.md)** — a step-by-step walkthrough with explanations of *why* each piece exists, aimed at PMs and operators (not just engineers)

### Want the technical reference instead?
1. Follow the [Base Setup Guide](docs/base-setup-guide.md) to get a working Telegram bot

### Already have a working bot? Add these in order:

**Priority 1 — Watchdog** (5 min, biggest reliability win):
- Copy [examples/watchdog/claude-bot-watchdog.sh](examples/watchdog/claude-bot-watchdog.sh)
- Customize the bot names, tmux sockets, and tokens
- Add to crontab: `*/5 * * * * ~/bin/claude-bot-watchdog.sh all >> ~/.claude/channels/watchdog.log 2>&1`
- Your bot will now auto-recover within 5 minutes of hitting context limits

**Priority 2 — Persistent Memory** (10 min):
- Copy a [state file template](examples/state-files/) into your project directory
- Copy the [user profile template](examples/personalization/user-profile-template.md) and fill in your basics
- Add the [CLAUDE.md instructions](docs/state-file-and-hooks.md#layer-2-aggressive-claudemd-instructions) to your bot's CLAUDE.md
- Add the [hooks config](examples/hooks/settings.local.json) to your project's `.claude/settings.local.json` (includes mandatory state-save gates + all 4 lifecycle hooks)
- Set up [credentials](examples/credentials/bot-credentials.env.example) in `~/.claude/bot-credentials.env`
- Your bot will now remember action items, decisions, context, and learn your preferences over time

**Priority 3 — Scheduled Tasks** (15 min per task):
- Copy the [cron script template](examples/cron-scripts/scheduled-task-template.sh)
- Customize the prompt and delivery method
- Add to crontab
- Your bot will now do things proactively without being asked

**Priority 4 — Memory Search** (15 min, long-term recall):
- Copy the [memory search scripts](examples/memory-search/) to `~/bin/` and `chmod +x` them
- Edit the `AGENT_SOURCES` / `AGENT_DIRS` dicts to match your directory layout
- The hooks config already calls `memory-search --index` at session start — the bot can now search its own history

**Priority 5 — Agent Skills** (drop-in):
- Browse [examples/agent-skills/](examples/agent-skills/) for reusable slash commands
- Copy any `.md` file into your project's `.claude/commands/` directory
- The bot can now run specialized audits, reviews, and analysis on demand

**Priority 6 — Inter-Agent Communication** (15 min, multi-bot only):
- Follow the [Inter-Agent Communication](docs/inter-agent-communication.md) guide
- Copy the [inbox-check script](examples/inter-agent/inbox-check) to `~/bin/`
- Each bot gets an `inbox.md` file and hooks that auto-check it before every reply

**Priority 7 — Fleet Hook Automation** (10 min, 3+ bots):
- Copy [examples/fleet-hooks/update-fleet-hooks.js](examples/fleet-hooks/update-fleet-hooks.js)
- Configure your bot definitions
- Run once to generate all hooks configs, re-run whenever you change the fleet

---

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated
- **Claude Max or Team subscription** (the bot uses your account's API quota)
- **Linux with systemd** (native or WSL2)
- **Telegram bot** created via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- **tmux** installed (`sudo apt install tmux`)

## Key Concepts

### State File = Working Memory
The bot writes a structured markdown file after every interaction. On restart, it reads this file first. This is how it "remembers" across sessions. Hooks enforce the discipline — the bot is **blocked from replying** until it saves unsaved state.

### Mandatory State-Save Gates (Production-Hardened)
The original "reminder" hooks were too gentle — bots would ignore them under pressure. The production fix: a **PreToolUse gate** on the Telegram reply tool that forces the bot to save state BEFORE it can send a reply. This is the single most important reliability improvement we made.

### 4-Hook Lifecycle = Nothing Falls Through the Cracks
Four hooks cover the full session lifecycle: **PreToolUse** loads state on first reply + gates every reply behind a state save, **PostToolUse** enforces a mandatory post-reply save, **PreCompact** is a last-chance emergency save before context compaction, **PostCompact** reindexes and reloads after compaction.

### User Profile = Long-Term Learning
A structured markdown file where the bot records what it learns about you — preferences, relationships, scheduling habits, communication style. Updated incrementally via PostToolUse hooks. Compounds over weeks into genuine personalization.

### Memory Search = Searchable History
SQLite FTS5 index across all bot files — state, profiles, daily notes, conversation logs, Claude Code memory files. The bot can search its own history when it needs to recall past decisions or context.

### Watchdog = Self-Healing
When Claude hits its context limit, the conversation "bakes" and the bot goes idle. The tmux session is still running, so `status` says RUNNING, but the bot is deaf. The watchdog inspects what's actually on the tmux screen every 5 minutes and restarts baked bots automatically.

### Cron One-Shots = Proactive Behavior
Scheduled tasks use `claude -p` (one-shot prompt mode), completely independent of the channel bot. They fire, run a prompt, send results to Telegram, and exit. The channel bot stays alive for interactive messages.

### Role Isolation = No Conflicts
Each bot's CLAUDE.md defines what it owns, what it must not do, and how to redirect questions to the other bot. Bots coordinate through files and databases, not shared memory.

### Inter-Agent Inbox = Asynchronous Coordination
Each bot has an `inbox.md` file. Bots write messages to each other's inboxes with priority levels and status tracking. A PreToolUse hook checks the inbox before every reply, so bots pick up messages automatically without polling.

### Fleet Hook Automation = Consistent Configuration
A Node.js script generates `.claude/settings.local.json` for all bots from a single config. When you need to change a hook pattern fleet-wide, edit one file and regenerate.

## Our Production Setup

For reference, here's what we actually run:

| Bot | Role | Cron Jobs | Integrations |
|-----|------|-----------|--------------|
| **COS** (Chief of Staff) | Email, calendar, admin, research | Timezone-aware briefings (every 30min, full at 6am/9am/noon/3pm/6pm local), weekly review (Fri 4pm) | Google Workspace, Notion, LinkedIn API, WebSearch |
| **CTO** | Cross-project architecture, standards, strategy | On-demand | Playwright, GitHub |
| **VPE-1** (VP Engineering) | Code review, PRs, architecture for Project A | On-demand | 45 agent skills, Playwright, GitHub |
| **VPE-2** (VP Engineering) | Code review, PRs, architecture for Project B | On-demand | 45 agent skills, Playwright, GitHub |
| **DevOps** | Fleet management, bot creation/maintenance | On-demand | All bot configs, systemd, cron |
| **Marketing** (Product Marketing) | Market research, content, thought leadership | Weekly research (Mon 6am), weekly use cases (Tue 6am) | Google Workspace, WebSearch |

All bots share:
- Isolated tmux sessions with separate sockets
- Structured state files with mandatory save-before-reply hooks
- Watchdog monitoring (5-min cron)
- Auto-start via systemd on boot
- Explicit role boundaries preventing overlap
- Inter-agent inbox for async coordination
- Memory search for long-term recall
- User profile for personalization
