#!/usr/bin/env bash
# death-rattle.sh — Notify the user via Telegram when a bot session is dying.
#
# Called from PreCompact and Stop hooks. Reads the bot's state file to
# extract what was being worked on, then sends a Telegram notification.
#
# Stop-mode has two suppressions to avoid noise:
#   1. Idle bots — if the AC section status isn't "in-progress", skip it.
#      Most sessions end naturally when no work is happening.
#   2. Cron one-shots — if CLAUDE_CRON=1 is set (by cron-ac-preseed.sh),
#      the session ending is expected, not a crash.
#
# Usage:
#   death-rattle.sh <bot-name> compact    # PreCompact: "context compacting"
#   death-rattle.sh <bot-name> stop       # Stop: "session ended"
#
# Environment: sources bot-credentials.env for tokens and chat ID.
